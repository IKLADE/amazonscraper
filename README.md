A web scraper is used to extract data from websites which can further be used to perform analysis.

Follow the steps to generate a dataset of your own:
1. Initialize search_term to whatever term you are using to scrape the data.
2. Initialize csv_file to the target csv file where you want to store the data. The csv file need not be created manaually, just a name for the file is sufficient
3. Run the script, and you get the dataset for your search term.
